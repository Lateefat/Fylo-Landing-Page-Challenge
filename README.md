## My process
- I created a css file and added added html tags to the index file given in the challenge. 
- I decided to add the styling as I went along.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- I learnt how to use Flexbox to style a responsive page.

### Continued development

- The challenge was given by the Sidehustle Intern 3.0 program, and the time was limited, I couldn't explore the use of the Grid sysytem in CSS.
- I hope to learn how to use Grid and continue learning Flexbox.
